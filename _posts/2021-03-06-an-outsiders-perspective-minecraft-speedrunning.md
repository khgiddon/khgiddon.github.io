title: Luck and skill in Minecraft speedrunning
---

I recently started reading up on the Minecraft speedrunning community. For anyone unfamiliar with "Minecraft" or "speedrunning": Minecraft is a video game based on exploration, world-building, and construction; and speedrunning is an attempt to complete a video game or part of a video game as quickly as possible. Speedrunning has grown into a popular subculture across many games: some of the most popular speedruns have [upward of 10 million views on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFkv6DtKf3w), and players frequently livestream speedrun attempts to substantial audiences on Twitch and other platforms. The website [speedrun.com](www.speedrun.com) serves as an archivist and provides leaderboards for many communities. As of March 2021, the site indicates that  Minecraft is the most popular game for speedrunning, with over 1,400 registered and active speedrunners.


I played Minecraft briefly back in 2011, when the game was still in beta. Back then, speedrunning as a whole was not the phenomenon it is today, but Minecraft was also basically impossible to speedrun because it was an open-ended sandbox game, and there was no obvious event one could attain in the game to mark the completion of a 'run.' But the game is continually being updated and since then the game has added boss fights; while there are different speedrunning "categories," most speedruns end with the player defeating a boss called the Ender Dragon.

My renewed interest in Minecraft was sparked by two factors:

### 1. The scandal

First, in December 2020, a prominent Minecraft speedrunner known as Dream was accused by the speedrunning community of cheating. Minecraft gameplay involves elements of randomness (killing hostile enemies drop items useful to the player with some probability). Dream received an exceptional sequence of item drops over a series of rns. The Minecraft Speedrunning Team (which "verifies" speedruns) released a [report](https://mcspeedrun.com/dream.pdf) that stating that the luck that Dream received was too good to be true, and concluded that Dream must have secretly modified his game in order to give himself better luck. Dream has denied all accusations but the community has generally agreed with the conclusions of the verifiers that Dream cheated. ([This article](https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/15/22176341/minecraft-youtube-dream-speedrun-cheating-mod-world-record-piglin) on *Polygon* provides a more detailed summary for anyone interested.)

The [report](https://mcspeedrun.com/dream.pdf) released by the Minecraft Speedrunning Team is an incredible artifact. It is thorough, precise, and rigorous; it explicitly tests the impact of various assumptions (i.e., conducts sensitivity analysis); and all Ã¥calculations are reproducible. That is to say, it meets all criteria that one could reasonably want for this type of analysis. The central calculation relies on application of the [binomial theorem](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/binomial-theorem/binomial-distribution-formula/) (which should be familiar with any student of statistics or anyone who does data science professionally). So there was a nice application of my current line of work to the nostalgia kick of a hobby from ten years ago. 

The whole affair has the added bonus of getting a bunch of 14-year-olds to read up on the binomial formula. What a boon for math education! I can't think of a better backdoor way to get across that hey-you-might-actually-be-interested-in-algebra. One might wager that considering the reach of the scandal and analyses, at least one incremental future student will major in statistics. Thanks, Dream.

### 2. "What it takes"

Second, I've always been drawn.

as someone who uses the binomial professionally, , and introduce probability and statistics to a new audience. (One might wager that considering the scope of the "scandal" and the reach of the subsequent analyses, at least one additional statistics major was produced by the incident.)

Second, 

I'm also always fascinated by vocational devotion in any arena, and the level of knowledge, (etc) that people use to make themselves the best.

My interests in this span high profile areas like sports, business, art, music, politics, literature, ., but also in particular subcultures. Video gaming is in many ways unique because of the lack of barriers

 Video games as they tend to be democratized in that age, education, or other credentials don't typically present any barriers to success or reaching the top of one's field. 

I don't think I've ever seen a snooker table in person, but I've been following the sport ever since reading about Ronnie O'Sullivan, the "unhappy king of snooker," in a [2015 *New Yorker* article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/follow-the-white-ball).

## A framework for Minecraft speedrunning

Getting the Minecraft speedrunning record (i.e., completing the game in the fastest time) requires *luck* and *skill*. There's a certain level of skill and practice one needs.?



What composes skill? We can think of things like game knowledge and how to react to, technical execution (can I produce the series of inputs needed into my computer to accomplish the result I am trying to achieve) . Much of speedrunning , is making adjustments on the fly and reacting to certain situations. What's not on the list above is discovering new strategies. Even though this is important to the game, for any player competing publicly, he or she is typically posting his or her runs for others to see, so any strategic innovation that provides real benefits is likely to be picked up by others, negating much of the discoverer's advantage. In fact, one could classify innovations in speedrunning as a [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)): as a piece of knowledge, they meet the traditional public good criteria of being non-excludable (one can't prevent someone else from using a new speedrunning strategy) and non-rivalrous (using a new strategy doesn't "use it up" and prevent others from using it.)
