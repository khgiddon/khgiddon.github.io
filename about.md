Hi, I'm Kyle. You can reach me at [kylegiddon@gmail.com](mailto:kylegiddon@gmail.com), or check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-giddon/).

I'm a Product Analyst/Data Scientist, and I'm currently taking some time to relax before starting a new role in late February.

Previously, I led the product analytics team at [Jobcase](https://www.jobcase.com/) in Cambridge, MA. My role involved founding and building the team to provide data-driven insights to solve business problems and deliver growth, and apply quantitative rigor to key decisions. My group's responsibilities spanned working with cross-functional teams through the product lifecycle, ad hoc analytics on company initiatives, and metric/data governance.

I have experience across:

* Product and user insights: Both exploratory and targeted analysis to discover insights about our users that drive product iteration and/or reveal business opportunities
* Operational analytics: experiment design and analysis (e.g., power analysis, A/B testing); investigation of hypotheses to support decision-making; forecasting; revenue optimization; marketing and funnel analytics
* Business intelligence and reporting: construction of executive-level reporting and alerting, design of key metrics and common data definitions across the organization; design of data intake and ETL processes to enable scalable reporting to internal and external stakeholders
* Advanced analytics: predictive analytics and modeling to support business and product operations
